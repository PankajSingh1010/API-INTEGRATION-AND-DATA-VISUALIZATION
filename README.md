# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED : API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION USING MATPLOTLIB OR SEABORN

Introduction

This report meticulously delineates the comprehensive development process of constructing a weather dashboard, utilizing real-time meteorological data procured from the OpenWeatherMap API. The project underscores data acquisition, processing, and visualization through advanced Python programming techniques and libraries. The ultimate deliverable is an intuitive and visually compelling dashboard. The project repository comprises:

Python Script: Responsible for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

Dashboard: A sophisticated graphical representation of weather metrics.

GitHub Repository: Contains all project artifacts, including scripts, visualization outputs, and supporting documentation.

This document provides an exhaustive discourse on the methodologies, technical nuances, and challenges encountered during the development process.

1. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this endeavor are:

To retrieve and process real-time weather data for specified geographical locations via the OpenWeatherMap API.

To transform raw data into user-friendly and analytically valuable formats.

To design and deploy a dashboard that delivers clear and actionable insights into weather parameters.

To provide detailed documentation for future reproducibility and scalability.

2. Prerequisites

2.1 Software and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are integral to the project:

Python 3.7+: The core programming language employed.

Requests: Facilitates seamless API communication.

Matplotlib: Enables high-quality graphical representation of data.

Seaborn: Augments visual aesthetics of plots.

Datetime: Assists in processing and formatting temporal data.

2.2 Account Setup

Registration on OpenWeatherMap is mandatory.

Obtain a unique API key post-registration for API interaction.

2.3 API Subscription Tier

The free subscription tier suffices for basic weather data access.

Ensure API key activation prior to initiating API calls.

3. Python Script: Technical Details

3.1 Data Acquisition

Code Implementation:

import requests

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key
city = "Kolkata"  # Specify desired city
url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}"
response = requests.get(url)

Technical Rationale:

Requests Library: Utilized to transmit GET requests to the API endpoint.

Dynamic URL Construction: Incorporates user-defined api_key and city to facilitate targeted queries.

Response Object: Captures server responses for subsequent data processing.

3.2 Validation of API Response

Code Implementation:

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("API call successful!", data)
else:
    print(f"API call failed with status code {response.status_code}")
    exit()

Technical Rationale:

HTTP Status Code Check: Ensures successful API interaction.

Error Handling: Provides informative feedback and terminates execution on failure.

3.3 Data Parsing and Conversion

Code Implementation:

temperature_kelvin = data['main']['temp']
humidity = data['main']['humidity']
wind_speed = data['wind']['speed']
weather_description = data['weather'][0]['description']

Technical Rationale:

Extracts critical meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Additional parameters like visibility, cloud coverage, and timestamps are similarly extracted for comprehensive analysis.

4. Visualization and Dashboard Design

4.1 Data Preparation

Code Implementation:

labels = ['Temperature (째C)', 'Feels Like (째C)', 'Humidity (%)', 'Wind Speed (m/s)', 'Cloud Coverage (%)', 'Visibility (m)', 'Weather Description', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset']
values = [temperature_celsius, feels_like_celsius, humidity, wind_speed, cloud_coverage, visibility, weather_description, sunrise_time, sunset_time]

Technical Rationale:

Defines labels and values for each weather metric to standardize data visualization.

Serves as the foundation for constructing visually coherent plots.

4.2 Dashboard Visualization

Code Implementation:

fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(18, 16))
axes[0, 0].barh(['Temperature (째C)'], [temperature_celsius], color='skyblue')
axes[0, 0].set_title(f"Temperature: {temperature_celsius:.2f}째C")

Technical Rationale:

Employs Matplotlib to create a grid of subplots for structured visualizations.

Customizes plot elements, including titles, axes labels, and annotations, to enhance interpretability.

5. Key Dashboard Components

The finalized dashboard encapsulates:

Temperature and Feels Like Metrics: Depicted through horizontal bar plots.

Humidity, Wind Speed, and Cloud Coverage: Visualized as individual plots for granularity.

Visibility: Presented as numerical bars for intuitive comprehension.

Weather Description: Displayed through concise textual annotations.

Sunrise and Sunset Timings: Presented in textual formats for clarity.

6. Documentation and Repository Organization

The project repository contains:

Python Script: Accompanied by extensive inline comments.

README File: Outlines project objectives, technical details, and usage instructions.

Visualization Outputs: Saved as .png files for demonstration purposes.

License: Ensures open-source accessibility.

7. Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

7.1 API Key Issues

Ensured proper configuration and activation of the API key.

Addressed subscription-tier limitations effectively.

7.2 Visualization Refinements

Implemented meticulous adjustments to axis labels, spacing, and overall aesthetics.

7.3 Data Formatting

Converted data into user-friendly formats, including Celsius for temperature and human-readable timestamps for temporal data.

8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

Efficient integration of the OpenWeatherMap API for dynamic weather data retrieval.

Advanced data processing and visualization techniques using Python.

The construction of an informative and visually appealing dashboard.

All deliverables are consolidated in a publicly accessible GitHub repository to facilitate reproducibility and further exploration.
